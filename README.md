## More information

mListy is reworked version of my old project that was named MovieList. It was created as an end of course project in [SoftUni](www.softuni.bg) and followed certain criteria made by them. This version is cleaned up and more nice looking.
The CSS is made by Dmitry Volkov. I bought it since I didn't want to use free templates and at that time I didn't have the time to spend on creating my own one. Maybe in the future I will rework it. You can find the template [HERE](https://themeforest.net/item/hotflix-online-movies-tv-shows-cinema-html-template/25128461).
Keep in mind that I changed quite a lot to fit my needs for my project. But the base is the same.
For that purpose you will not find the main CSS and some JS in this repo. If you like it please go and support the author.

## Problems

Some things that were not fixed:
- mListy is not responsive;
- Lacks filtering in the custom Lists. Currently, they are sorted first by grade and then name;
- Supports only Movies and not TV-series and other types;
- Lacking more futures. No things such as last viewed movies, category filtering etc... maybe in the future.
